Documentation
-------------

As nacelle is largely derived from webapp2, so it follows that a large part of
its documentation has been derived from there too. A lot of nacelle's
documentation has been copied verbatim from webapp2's. Some docs have examples
changed to suit nacelle's style, and sections added or removed where
appropriate.
