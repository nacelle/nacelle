## Documentation

As a large part of nacelle is derived from webapp2, so it follows that a large part of its documentation has been derived from there too. A lot of nacelle's documentation has been copied verbatim from webapp2's. Some docs have examples changed to suit nacelle's style, and sections added or removed where appropriate.
