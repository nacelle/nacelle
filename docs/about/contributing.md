# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of contribution

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/rehabstudio/nacelle/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

-  Your operating system name and version.
-  Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
-  Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
-  A failing test case if possible


### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Fix anything you can, if you're not sure about something, just ask.


### Implement Features

Look through the Github issues for already planned or in-development features and help out on one of those if you're interested.

If you are proposing a feature:

-  Explain in detail how it would work.
-  Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
-  Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)


### Write Documentation

Nacelle could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.


### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/rehabstudio/nacelle/issues.


## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Make sure to add the feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7. Check https://travis-ci.org/rehabstudio/nacelle/pull_requests and make sure that the tests pass.
