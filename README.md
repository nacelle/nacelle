nacelle microframework
======================

nacelle probably isn't what you would normally define as a framework. nacelle could more accurately (but less succinctly) be described as a collection of awesome python libraries, a rock solid app and CMS skeleton built on appengine using webapp2, jinja2 and bootstrap, some sane defaults and an extensively documented code base.

NOTE: Before reading any further, if you need portability from appengine or a relational database then nacelle probably isn't for you, use CloudSQL and Django, you'll thank me later.

The bulk of nacelle's documentation lives within the code as docstrings, included documentation gives a high level overview of the available tools and pointers to further documentation online. nacelle's codebase is still quite small and so the best way to learn is to dive right in. The best place to start is probably the included CMS skeleton, the user functionality is a simple example of how the CMS functionality works.

nacelle doesn't aim to do the work for you, you'll still have to write templates and handlers and probably routes too. What nacelle does do is provide a solid base app skeleton with a set of useful tools that enable you to build exactly the app you need, exactly the way you want, quickly.
